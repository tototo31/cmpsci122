Merge sort:
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm and it is one of the most respected algorithims
merge sort continually splits a list in half. if the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition
if the list has more than one item we split the list and recursively invoke a merge algorithm

Quick sort:
quick sort is  a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot
one side holds elements smaller than the pivot and the other one hold elements greater than the pivot
we can pick a pivot in different ways: pick the first element, pick the last element, pick a random element, pick the median
partitioning begins by locating two position markers (left and right) at the beginnning and end of the remaining items in the list
