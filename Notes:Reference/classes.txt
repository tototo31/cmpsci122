you always need to include self in a class function

def MyClass:
	def method(self, arg1, arg 2):
		statements

__init__ is a special initializer function it is run everytime a new instance is started

def __init__(self):
	self.i = 12345

it can have more than one argument aswell
methods are functions contained within classes. they are defined in the same way as a function

to access an instance variable remember to do self.var rather than just var

To create a class that cal be called without the need of a running instance you put @classmethod before it to denote it can be run without the instance.

ex.
@classmethod
def myFunction(self):
	pass

this can be run wihtout creating an instance of the class
