when you write a program you should be concerned about the resource needs of the program. The two main resources to consider are time and memory
The resource to optimize for depends on the application and the computing system
the ammout of resources consumed often depends on the amount of data you have

Algorithm analysis does not answer the question "How much of a resource is consumed to process?" but rather "What is the worst case?"
