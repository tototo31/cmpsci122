Stacks:
A stack is FILO (First In Last Out)

Pushing an item to the stack puts an item on top
Popping an item off the stack removes the top item

Unlike the linked list the only pointer we need is the tail pointer

Stacks can be used for post fix mathmatical calculations


Queues:
Ordered collection of iterms where the addition of new items happens at one end(tail) and removal of existing items happens at the other end(head)
operations - 
	enqueue - append an element to tail
	dequeue - remove an element from the head
	isEmpty - returns true if there are no items in queue
	peek - returns the head of the queue without removing it
	size - returns number of items in the queue
